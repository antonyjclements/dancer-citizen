# Enforcement Gates, Telemetry, Org Knowledge, Traceability, Workflow Trace, and Behavior Pins

A practical guide to `.scripts/aw-gate.js` — the dependency-free helper that turns
the workflow's advisory review/capture/compliance steps into a deterministic,
enforceable contract, records lightweight telemetry, and syncs an org-shared
knowledge tier.

All seven capabilities are **opt-in and disabled by default**. This guide covers
what they are, how to configure them, and how to wire enforcement into a Git hook
or CI. For the terse schema, see [README.md](README.md); this file is the how-to.

> **What gates guarantee — and what they don't.** A gate proves a step *ran*
> recently (`age` mode) or *against the current code* (`commit` mode). It does
> **not** prove the step was done *well* — a rushed review still stamps the review
> gate. Gates are workflow **accountability**, not quality assurance: they make
> "did we review this?" enforceable and deterministic, while the judgment of
> whether the review was any good stays with the agent and the humans. Keep that
> boundary in mind when deciding what to gate on.
>
> **Receipts close the "stamp without running" gap.** Left alone, `record review`
> is a single command an agent can run to clear a blocked push *without running
> `aw-review` at all*. When `gates.require_receipt` is on, `record` refuses to
> stamp unless the skill has just written a fresh, gate-named **receipt**
> summarizing what it did, and consumes that receipt (single-use) so it cannot
> re-stamp a later commit. This does not make a lazy review good — it raises the
> floor from "type one command" to "produce recent, substantive, single-use
> evidence", and leaves an auditable trail. It is a deterrent and an audit aid,
> not a proof of quality.

## 1. The idea in one paragraph

Review and compliance are LLM-driven — they cannot block a merge on their own.
So instead of trying to run an agent in CI, the workflow splits the job in two:
a skill **stamps a freshness marker** when it finishes (`record`), and a tiny
deterministic checker **enforces** that the marker is fresh (`check`). The checker
is plain Node + git, needs no agent and no API key, and you wire it wherever you
want it to block. The workflow ships the mechanism and the contract; you choose
the enforcement point.

---

## 2. Install

The helper is installed by `aw-init` behind a flag:

```sh
skills/aw-init/scripts/install.sh --with-gates --repo /path/to/repo
```

This adds `<repo>/.scripts/aw-gate.js`, appends `.aw-gate-state.json`,
`.aw-org-cache/`, `.aw/tmp/`, `.aw/workflow-trace.jsonl`, and `.aw/pin/` to
`.gitignore`, and writes the `gates` / `telemetry` / `org_knowledge` / `trace` /
`workflow_trace` / `pin` sections to `docs/workflow/config.yml` (those config sections
are written on every install; the script itself is gated behind `--with-gates`).

Existing installs: re-run the installer with `--with-gates`, or
`skills/aw-init/scripts/upgrade.sh` to add the config sections.

The script requires **Node ≥ 16** at the enforcement point (local hook or CI).

---

## 3. The CLI

```sh
node .scripts/aw-gate.js receipt <gate> --summary "text" [--detail "text"]
node .scripts/aw-gate.js record <event> [--detail "text"] [--no-receipt]
node .scripts/aw-gate.js check [--against head|worktree]
node .scripts/aw-gate.js trace [--base <ref>] [--json] [--out <path>]
node .scripts/aw-gate.js trace-annotate <spec|test|code> --file <path> --line <n> --id <ID>[,<ID>]
node .scripts/aw-gate.js trace-annotate --batch .aw/tmp/trace-intents.<token>.json [--delete-batch-on-success]
node .scripts/aw-gate.js workflow-record <event> [--tier <tier>] [--step <step>] [--gate <gate>] [--status <status>] [--reason <text>]
node .scripts/aw-gate.js workflow-check [--base <ref>] [--since-commit <ref>] [--json]
node .scripts/aw-gate.js pin run [--json] [--out <path>]
node .scripts/aw-gate.js pin check [--base <ref>] [--json]
node .scripts/aw-gate.js org-sync
```

### `receipt <gate>`

Writes a git-ignored **proof-of-work receipt** for `<gate>` to
`<gates.receipt_dir>/<gate>.json` (default `.aw/receipts/<gate>.json`). The skill
calls this when it finishes, passing a `--summary` that restates what it did. The
receipt records `{ gate, ts, commit, summary, detail }`. `record` verifies and
then consumes it.

```sh
node .scripts/aw-gate.js receipt review --summary "reviewed the auth diff; fixed one P1, no P0s"
```

`--summary` is required and must be non-empty — an empty summary is refused, so
stamping always carries at least a stated claim of what ran.

### `record <event>`

Stamps the current **time and commit** for `<event>` into the git-ignored state
file (`gates.state_file`, default `.aw-gate-state.json`). When `telemetry.enabled`
is true, it also appends a no-PII event to the telemetry log. Idempotent — the
latest stamp wins.

```sh
node .scripts/aw-gate.js record review --detail "code review"
```

When the gate is **receipt-required** (`gates.require_receipt: true`, or a
per-gate `checks.<name>.require_receipt: true`), `record` first verifies a fresh,
gate-matching receipt written by `receipt <gate>`:

- the receipt's `gate` must equal `<event>`;
- its `summary` must be non-empty;
- its `ts` must be within `gates.receipt_max_age_minutes` (default 180) — a stale
  or reused-from-last-week receipt is rejected;

then folds a digest of it into the state entry and **deletes** the receipt so it
is single-use. Without a valid receipt, `record` exits non-zero and does not
stamp. `--no-receipt` bypasses this check with a loud stderr warning — it exists
only for bootstrap (the commit that first enables the gate, fresh clones, hand
use), never to skip running the skill.

The bundled skills call `receipt` then `record` automatically when they finish:
`aw-review` → `review`, `aw-capture` → `capture`,
`aw-check-workflow-compliance` → `check_workflow_compliance`,
`aw-synthesize-memory` → `synthesize`. `aw-synthesize-memory` records its gate
on every invocation, including no-op runs with no unprocessed sessions (its
receipt summary says so), so an age-based `synthesize` gate can enforce periodic
memory review. You can also call them by hand.

### `check`

Reads `gates` from config and exits non-zero if any configured gate is stale.
Exit **0** means every gate is fresh (or gates are disabled); exit **1** means at
least one failed, with a line per failure explaining why. This is the command you
put in a hook or CI job.

- `--against head` (default): commit-mode gates compare the recorded commit to
  `HEAD`. Use in a **pre-push** hook or CI.
- `--against worktree`: compare to the working tree (staged + unstaged). Use in a
  **pre-commit** hook so edits not yet committed are considered.

When `docs/metrics/**` has staged, modified, or untracked files, `check` also
prints a non-blocking warning. Those files are workflow exhaust produced by
tracking and telemetry; commit them before opening a PR.

`check` also validates the **learning audit trail** whenever `gates.enabled` is
true, independently of what is configured under `gates.checks`. Every
`docs/learnings/*.md` must carry a non-empty `derived-from`, and its
`evidence-count` must equal the number of identifiers listed. A learning that
cites no session cannot be corroborated, expired on schedule, or traced back to
where the lesson came from.

This runs here rather than only in `scripts/test-install.sh` because that script
executes in the augmented-workflow repo and its test-install targets — never in
your repo, which is where learnings actually accumulate.

The usual cause of a failure is a learning written mid-session by
`aw-capture learning`: the session log and its `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>` identifier
are not created until the session ends, so at capture time there was nothing to
cite. Fix it by adding the identifier of the session the lesson came from, and
correcting `evidence-count` to match. A repo with no `docs/learnings/`
directory passes.

Some learnings genuinely have no session to cite — those written before the repo
adopted the memory loop, or imported from elsewhere. Exempt one by stating why,
in the learning itself:

```yaml
derived-from: []
audit-trail-exempt: predates the memory loop (2026-07-02); no session log exists to cite
```

The reason is required: `audit-trail-exempt:` with nothing after it exempts
nothing. The exemption lives in the file rather than in a list inside the tool
so that it travels with the artifact and has to be justified in the diff where a
reviewer will see it.

`check` additionally validates **derived state** — registries and the context
wiki are generated from source artifacts, so they drift silently and nothing
fails at runtime; an agent simply follows a pointer to a file that is not there.
It reports:

- an `index.yml` entry whose `path` or `spec` names a file that no longer exists
- a `docs/features/*/spec.md` with no entry in `docs/features/index.yml`
- a learning, standard, or wiki citing a session by **path** rather than by
  identifier (retention deletes the log, so the link dangles)
- a wiki reference to a `docs/`, `scripts/`, or `skills/` path that is missing
- an `index.yml` this tool cannot parse

Index files are workflow-generated, so the parser accepts a narrow shape and
**reports what it does not recognize instead of guessing** — a validator that
silently misparses would report safety it does not provide. The shape is a
top-level `<name>:` key over a block list of maps (`  - key: value`,
continuation `    key: value`, nested lists `      - item`), or `<name>: []`.
Scalar keys beside the list are accepted and not inspected.

### `validate`

The same derived-state and audit-trail checks, without the freshness gates:

```bash
node .scripts/aw-gate.js validate
```

Exit **0** means derived state is consistent; exit **1** lists what drifted.
Unlike `check` it does not read `gates.enabled` and needs no recorded state, so
it works in a repo that has not adopted gates at all. `check` runs these checks
too, so wiring `validate` separately is only worth it if you want registry
validation without gate freshness.

### `org-sync`

Shallow-clones or updates the configured org knowledge repo into the git-ignored
cache. No-op when `org_knowledge.source` is blank.

### `trace`

Checks opt-in spec traceability without an agent:

- every `@spec` reference in test/code points to a living spec requirement
- every requirement has at least one test anchor
- missing code anchors warn by default, or fail when `trace.require_code_anchor`
  is true
- with `--base <ref>`, changed anchored tests must be paired with a changed
  owning spec or a `Spec-Override:` commit trailer

Exit 0 means clean, warnings-only, or disabled. Exit 1 means at least one error
finding. `--json` prints a stable `{ summary, matrix, findings }` object, and
`--out <path>` writes the same object for CI artifacts.

### `trace-annotate`

Skills use this as the deterministic policy boundary for writing annotations.
When `trace.enabled` is false it skips writes; when a safe batch file under
`.aw/tmp/trace-intents.*.json` is supplied, it deletes that transient file before
exiting. When enabled it validates IDs and line targets before writing.

`aw-work` should prefer batch mode so subagents return annotation intents to the
parent, the parent writes one `.aw/tmp/trace-intents.<token>.json`, and the helper
merges labels and applies edits once:

```json
{
  "intents": [
    { "kind": "test", "file": "src/auth.test.ts", "line": 34, "ids": ["AUTH-001"] },
    { "kind": "code", "file": "src/auth.ts", "line": 8, "ids": ["AUTH-001", "AUTH-002"] }
  ]
}
```

Use `--delete-batch-on-success` for normal enabled runs. Failed enabled batches
are preserved for debugging unless the caller removes them in its cleanup step.

### `workflow-record`

Appends one process breadcrumb to `workflow_trace.path` when
`workflow_trace.enabled` is true:

```sh
node .scripts/aw-gate.js workflow-record tier --tier feature --reason "workflow behavior changed"
node .scripts/aw-gate.js workflow-record step --step aw-work --status ran --artifact docs/features/foo/spec.md
```

When disabled, it exits 0 without writing. Separately, `record <gate>`
automatically appends a `gate` event when workflow trace is enabled, so freshness
gate execution can be checked as process evidence.

### `workflow-check`

Reads `workflow_trace.path` and exits non-zero when required breadcrumbs are
missing. The initial checks are deliberately small: a tier event when
`workflow_trace.require_tier` is true, and gate events named in
`workflow_trace.required_gates`. Use `--base` or `--since-commit` to consider
only events recorded by commits in that range. Appends retain the newest
`workflow_trace.max_events` entries and trim oldest lines until the file is under
`workflow_trace.max_bytes`.

### `pin run`

Runs each `docs/features/*/behavior-pin.yml` manifest. The default same-repo mode
compares the manifest's old `base` with the current checkout, copying current
oracle/support files into a temporary worktree so both sides run the same
harness. `mode: reference-repo` checks out `reference.repo` at `reference.ref`
under `.aw/pin/` and runs the current-tree harness once with
`AW_PIN_REFERENCE_ROOT`, `AW_PIN_CANDIDATE_ROOT`, `AW_PIN_MANIFEST`,
`AW_PIN_MODE`, and optional `AW_PIN_GOLDEN_ROOT`.

Results are written to `pin.out` with verdicts:

- `pass`: old and new both pass
- `pin-not-characterizing`: old/reference failed, so the oracle does not describe reality
- `equivalence-broken`: old/reference passed and new failed

Manifest `setup` and `harness` commands must be empty or
`node <repo-relative .js path>`. `pin run` does not execute shell strings.
Reference-repo harnesses can exit `10` to report `pin-not-characterizing`.
Golden fixture config is recorded as provenance but does not replace live
reference execution.

### `pin check`

Checks commit history from `--base` (default `origin/main`) to `HEAD` and fails
when one commit changes both a pin's subject and its oracle/support files. Use a
manifest-scoped `Pin-Override: docs/features/<feature>/behavior-pin.yml — <reason>`
trailer only when coupling those edits is intentional.

## 4. Gate configuration

```yaml
gates:
  enabled: true                  # master switch; false makes `check` a no-op
  require_receipt: true          # `record` needs a fresh receipt from the skill
  receipt_dir: .aw/receipts      # where receipts are written (git-ignored)
  receipt_max_age_minutes: 180   # how recent a receipt must be to count
  state_file: .aw-gate-state.json
  checks:
    review:
      mode: commit
      paths:
        - "."
        - ":(exclude)docs"
    check_workflow_compliance:
      mode: age
      max_age_hours: 168
    synthesize:
      mode: age
      max_age_hours: 336
```

- `enabled` — when `false`, `check` prints "gates disabled" and exits 0. Nothing
  is enforced until you flip this to `true`.
- `state_file` — where `record` writes markers. Keep it git-ignored; it is
  per-checkout local state, not shared.
- `checks.<name>` — one entry per gate. `<name>` is the event the matching skill
  records. Remove an entry to stop enforcing that gate (the skill still records
  it harmlessly).
- `require_receipt` — when `true`, `record <name>` refuses to stamp unless the
  skill has just written a fresh receipt (see [§3](#3-the-cli)). Defaults to
  `false` in the tool for backward compatibility; the installer ships it `true`.
  A per-gate `checks.<name>.require_receipt` boolean overrides this default for
  one gate — e.g. keep it strict for `review` but relax it for `synthesize`.
- `receipt_dir` — where receipts are written and consumed. Keep it git-ignored;
  the installer adds `.aw/receipts/` to `.gitignore`.
- `receipt_max_age_minutes` — how recent a receipt must be to be accepted
  (default 180). Tightening it forces the skill to have run closer to the stamp.

### Modes

| Mode | Fresh while… | Needs | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `age` (default) | recorded within `max_age_hours` | nothing (git-free) | time-triggered checks that should re-run periodically even when code is unchanged (compliance) |
| `commit` | the gate's `paths` are unchanged since the recorded commit | git; recorded commit reachable | change-triggered checks (review, spec drift) |
| `commit-and-age` | both of the above hold | git + a window | high-assurance gates |

`age` answers *"did this run recently?"* — simple, and it can force a weekly
re-run. `commit` answers *"has the current code been checked?"* — a review from
last week on untouched code stays valid, while any relevant change invalidates it.
Pick per gate; there is no global default beyond `age`.

### Scoping a commit-mode gate with `paths`

`paths` is a list of **git pathspecs** limiting which changes invalidate the gate.
Omit it and *any* commit invalidates the gate. Common patterns:

```yaml
paths:
  - "."                 # everything under the repo root, then narrow with excludes:
  - ":(exclude)docs"    # ...but ignore docs/ — a docs-only change stays fresh
```

```yaml
paths:
  - "src"               # only changes under src/ matter
  - "docs/features"     # ...plus the living specs
```

`:(exclude)<path>` (equivalently `:!<path>`) is git's exclude magic. At least one
positive pathspec (like `.` or `src`) must be present alongside excludes.

### Config parsing: the supported YAML subset

`aw-gate.js` reads `config.yml` with a **deliberately partial, dependency-free
YAML parser** — enough for this workflow's config and nothing more. The upside is
zero dependencies and full portability; the cost is that config outside the
supported subset **misparses silently rather than erroring**. Keep edits within
this subset (or, if the grammar ever needs to grow, the tool should adopt a real
YAML library instead of stretching the parser):

**Supported**

- Nested block mappings by indentation (`key:` then indented children).
- Scalars: strings (optionally `"double"`/`'single'` quoted), booleans
  (`true`/`false`), null (`~` or `null`), integers, floats.
- Block scalar lists — `paths:` then indented `- item` lines.
- Inline flow scalar arrays — `paths: ["src", ":(exclude)docs"]` (no commas
  *inside* an item).
- Full-line comments (`# ...`) and blank lines.

**Not supported — avoid these; they misparse without an error**

- **Trailing/inline comments on a value line.** `enabled: true # note` parses the
  value as the string `"true # note"`, so the gate is silently treated as
  disabled. Put comments on their own line.
- **A bare `key:` with no value.** This parser reads it as a child *mapping*
  (`{}`), not null or `""`. For a blank string, write it explicitly — e.g.
  `source: ""`, not `source:`. (A bare `org_knowledge.source:` yields an object,
  which `org-sync` now treats as unset and skips rather than misusing.)
- Inline flow maps (`{a: b}`) and block lists of maps (`- key: value`).
- Multi-line/folded scalars (`|`, `>`), anchors/aliases (`&`, `*`), tags (`!!type`).
- A comma inside a quoted item of an inline array.

The same subset is documented at the top of `.scripts/aw-gate.js`, beside the
parser. The installer's default `config.yml` and every example in this guide stay
inside it.

---

## 5. Wiring enforcement

The workflow does **not** install a hook — you choose the enforcement point.

### Option A: husky pre-push (this repo)

This repo uses [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/). `.husky/pre-push`
contains:

```sh
node .scripts/aw-gate.js check
node .scripts/aw-gate.js trace
node .scripts/aw-gate.js pin check
```

`npm install` re-installs the hooks (via the `prepare` script), so every clone is
protected. A stale gate makes `check` exit 1 and Git aborts the push.

### Option B: a plain Git hook (no npm)

```sh
# .git/hooks/pre-push   (chmod +x)
#!/bin/sh
node .scripts/aw-gate.js check || {
  echo "Push blocked: a workflow gate is stale. Re-run the skill, then push." >&2
  exit 1
}
```

### Option C: pre-commit (catch it earlier)

```sh
# .husky/pre-commit  or  .git/hooks/pre-commit
node .scripts/aw-gate.js check --against worktree
```

### Option D: CI required check

```yaml
# GitHub Actions
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0          # commit-mode gates need history to resolve the recorded commit
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: 20
- run: node .scripts/aw-gate.js check
- run: node .scripts/aw-gate.js trace --base origin/${{ github.base_ref }}
- run: node .scripts/aw-gate.js pin check --base origin/${{ github.base_ref }}
- run: node .scripts/aw-gate.js pin run
```

Make it a **required** status check on the branch so a red gate blocks merge.
Only add trace or pin lines after enabling their config. Disabled commands are
no-ops, but CI jobs are useful only for opted-in repos.

> **Shallow clones:** commit mode resolves the recorded commit with git. In CI,
> fetch full history (`fetch-depth: 0`); otherwise the recorded commit may be
> absent and the gate fails asking you to re-run.

---

## 6. Spec traceability conventions

Traceability is opt-in and disabled by default:

```yaml
trace:
  enabled: false
  spec_paths:
    - "docs/features/*/spec.md"
  test_paths:
    - "*.feature"
    - "*.test.ts"
    - "*.test.tsx"
    - "*.spec.ts"
  code_paths:
    - "src"
  require_code_anchor: false
```

Requirement IDs are markdown headings in living specs:

```markdown
### AUTH-001 — Session expires after inactivity
```

Tests anchor to requirements on or immediately above the test/scenario:

```ts
// @spec:AUTH-001
test('session ends after 30 idle minutes', () => {})
```

Code anchors belong only at behavior entry points:

```ts
// @spec AUTH-001, AUTH-002
export function createSession() {}
```

When a test legitimately changes without its owning spec, include a commit
trailer:

```text
Spec-Override: AUTH-001 — test asserted the wrong boundary
```

An anchor proves a link was claimed, not that the code conforms. Coupling proves
a change was coordinated, not that it was correct. Traceability is workflow
accountability, not quality assurance.

---

## 7. Workflow execution trace

Workflow trace is opt-in and disabled by default:

```yaml
workflow_trace:
  enabled: false
  path: .aw/workflow-trace.jsonl
  require_tier: true
  required_gates:
    - review
    - check_workflow_compliance
```

The file is git-ignored local process evidence. Use `workflow-record` for
explicit process facts and `workflow-check` to validate configured breadcrumbs:

```sh
node .scripts/aw-gate.js workflow-record tier --tier feature --reason "workflow behavior changed"
node .scripts/aw-gate.js workflow-check
```

When enabled, every `record <gate>` call also writes a `gate` event to this file.

---

## 8. The everyday loop

1. You do work and run a skill — e.g. `aw-review`. On completion it writes a
   receipt (`receipt review --summary "…"`) and then runs
   `node .scripts/aw-gate.js record review`, which verifies and consumes that
   receipt and stamps the current commit/time. If the skill did not run, there is
   no receipt and `record` refuses to stamp.
2. You push. The pre-push hook runs `node .scripts/aw-gate.js check`.
3. If the review gate is fresh (no non-doc changes since the review, per its
   `paths`), the push proceeds. If you changed code after reviewing, the gate is
   stale and the push is blocked until you review again.

You rarely call `record` by hand — the skills do it. `check` runs automatically
via the hook.

---

## 9. First-push bootstrap

A gate cannot validate the commit that *installs* it: enabling gates and adding
the hook are themselves non-doc changes, so the review gate is stale for that
commit. For that one push, bypass the hook once:

```sh
git push --no-verify
```

Or record after committing, then push normally. With `require_receipt` on, this
first commit has no receipt yet, so bypass the receipt check once:

```sh
node .scripts/aw-gate.js record review --no-receipt
git push
```

After the bootstrap, the normal loop enforces every subsequent push.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Message from `check` | Meaning | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gates disabled … skipping` (exit 0) | `gates.enabled` is not `true` | set `gates.enabled: true` |
| `<gate>: never recorded` | no marker yet | run the skill, or `record <gate>` (first run / fresh clone — state is per-checkout and git-ignored) |
| `no receipt at … — run the skill` (from `record`) | receipt-required gate has no fresh receipt | run the skill (it writes the receipt), or `receipt <gate> --summary "…"` then `record`; bootstrap only: `record <gate> --no-receipt` |
| `receipt … is stale` / `is for gate "X"` (from `record`) | receipt too old or for the wrong gate | re-run the skill so it writes a fresh, correct receipt, then `record` |
| `<gate>: stale (last run Nh ago, limit Mh)` | age-mode window exceeded | re-run the skill |
| `<gate>: code changed in <paths> … since it last ran` | commit-mode: relevant paths changed | re-run the review/skill, then re-record |
| `<gate>: recorded commit <sha> not found (rebased or shallow clone)` | the recorded commit is gone | re-run the skill; in CI use `fetch-depth: 0` |
| `<gate>: invalid or missing max_age_hours` | age/`commit-and-age` gate lacks a window | add `max_age_hours` |
| `trace disabled … skipping` | `trace.enabled` is not `true` | set `trace.enabled: true` after adopting IDs and anchors |
| `dangling-test-ref` / `dangling-code-ref` | an anchor points at a missing requirement ID | fix the ID or add the living spec requirement |
| `untested-requirement` | a requirement has no test anchor | add or annotate coverage, or remove stale requirement text |
| `uncoupled-test-change` | an anchored test changed without its owning spec | update the spec or add a `Spec-Override:` trailer |

The state file is **local and git-ignored**, so a fresh clone or CI checkout
starts with every gate "never recorded". That is intended — enforcement is about
*this* checkout's work. In CI, either record as part of the pipeline or scope the
gate to what CI can verify.

---

## 11. Telemetry

With `telemetry.enabled: true`, each `record` call also appends one JSON line to
`telemetry.path` (default `docs/metrics/events.jsonl`):

```json
{ "ts": "2026-07-03T12:00:00.000Z", "event": "review", "detail": "code", "source": "aw-gate" }
```

It records **only** an event name, timestamp, optional short detail, and source —
no code, no diffs, no PII.

### Rotation, retention, and merge conflicts

The log is append-only and git-tracked, which would otherwise grow without bound
and conflict at the tail when branches merge. Two defaults prevent that:

- **Monthly rotation** (`rotation: monthly`) writes to `events-YYYY-MM.jsonl`, so
  each file stays bounded and concurrent branches usually touch different months.
  `rotation: none` keeps a single `events.jsonl`.
- **`union` merge** — `aw-init --with-gates` adds `docs/metrics/events*.jsonl merge=union`
  to `.gitattributes`. When two branches do append to the same shard, git keeps
  both sides' lines instead of raising a conflict; order is irrelevant since each
  line carries its own `ts`.

Prune old shards with retention (git history keeps the removed data):

```sh
node .scripts/aw-gate.js prune-telemetry   # deletes shards older than telemetry.retention_months (default 12)
```

`aw-synthesize-memory` runs this as part of its retention pass, so you rarely call
it by hand.

Aggregate across all shards (`events*.jsonl`):

```sh
node -e 'const fs=require("fs"),p=require("path");const d="docs/metrics";const c={};for(const f of fs.readdirSync(d))if(/^events.*\.jsonl$/.test(f))for(const l of fs.readFileSync(p.join(d,f),"utf8").trim().split("\n"))if(l){const e=JSON.parse(l).event;c[e]=(c[e]||0)+1}console.log(c)'
```

Telemetry is independent of gates — you can run either without the other. Schema
detail lives in [../metrics/README.md](../metrics/README.md).

## 12. Org-shared knowledge

Point `org_knowledge.source` at a git repo of shared learnings and standards to
add an org-wide tier alongside the repo-local `docs/learnings/` and
`docs/standards/`, replacing the per-machine `~/.agents/learnings/` fallback:

```yaml
org_knowledge:
  source: "https://github.com/acme/engineering-knowledge.git"
  ref: main
  cache_dir: .aw-org-cache
  paths:
    learnings: learnings
    standards: standards
```

`node .scripts/aw-gate.js org-sync` shallow-clones or updates that repo into the
git-ignored cache. `aw-capture`, `aw-synthesize-memory`, and
`aw-discover-standards` read the org tier (repo-local first, then org-shared) so a
repo-local entry does not duplicate an org-wide one.

Because one edit to the org base steers agents across every subscribing repo, it
is **governed content, not just a synced folder**: one accountable owner (a senior
lead or distinguished engineer), PR-reviewed changes, self-describing entries
(`authority`, `applies_to`, `owner`, `reviewed`/`review_by`, `source`), advisory-
by-default with repo-local precedence, and a human-gated promotion path — skills
never write to it. Pin `org_knowledge.ref` to a reviewed tag for change control.
The full model and templates are in [org-knowledge.md](org-knowledge.md).

## 13. This repo's configuration (worked example)

For reference, `docs/workflow/config.yml` in this repository enforces:

- **`review` — `commit` mode**, scoped `["." , ":(exclude)docs"]`. A docs-only
  change keeps the gate fresh; any change to skills, scripts, or the tool requires
  a fresh review before push.
- **`check_workflow_compliance` — `age` mode, 168h.** Compliance reflects process
  rather than a specific diff, so a weekly window fits better than a commit gate.
- **No `capture` gate.** `aw-capture` still records its marker, but blocking a
  *push* on capture staleness is noise, so it is omitted from `gates.checks`.

Enforcement is a husky `pre-push` hook running `node .scripts/aw-gate.js check`,
`node .scripts/aw-gate.js trace`, and `node .scripts/aw-gate.js pin check`.
Trace, telemetry, and org knowledge are left disabled by default; pinning is
enabled in this repo because it carries a real self-pin.
